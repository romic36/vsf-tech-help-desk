# Fix for Vercel Deployment Error

## The Error You Encountered:
```
Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1
```

## Root Cause:
Vercel couldn't find the correct entry point for the build process.

## Solution: Updated Configuration

I've created new configuration files to fix this issue:

### 1. Updated `vercel.json` Configuration:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist/public"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "server/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server/index.ts"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Added Build Script (`build.js`):
A custom build script that handles the frontend and backend build process correctly.

## New Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Download Updated Files
1. Download the project again from Replit (it now has the fixes)
2. Extract to your computer

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Delete all old files
3. Upload the new files (including the fixed `vercel.json`)

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Settings" → "Build & Output Settings"
4. Set these values:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## Alternative: Simple Static Deployment

If the full-stack deployment still has issues, you can deploy as a static site:

### Step 1: Build Locally
1. Open terminal in your project folder
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm run build`
4. The `dist/public` folder contains your static files

### Step 2: Deploy Static Files
1. In Vercel, create a new project
2. Upload only the `dist/public` folder
3. Set as static site

## Verification:
After deployment, your site should:
- Load the homepage ✅
- Show Victoria School branding ✅
- Display the help desk interface ✅
- Handle form submissions ✅

## If You Still Have Issues:

### Option A: Contact Support
- Vercel has excellent support for deployment issues
- Share this error message with them

### Option B: Try Alternative Platform
- **Netlify**: Often easier for React apps
- **GitHub Pages**: Simple static hosting
- **Railway**: Good for full-stack apps

### Option C: Manual Deploy
- Build locally with `npm run build`
- Upload `dist/public` folder to any static hosting

## Success Indicators:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Site loads at your Vercel URL
- ✅ All pages work correctly
- ✅ Forms submit properly
