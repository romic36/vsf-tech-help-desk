# Fixed Vercel Deployment Guide - Victoria School Tech Help Desk

## Problem Resolved

The error "Could not resolve entry module 'client/index.html'" has been fixed by updating the Vercel configuration to properly handle your Vite-based monorepo structure.

## Files Updated

### 1. **vercel.json** - Fixed Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server/index.ts"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/$1"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "server/index.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30,
      "includeFiles": "dist/**"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **build-vercel.js** - Custom Build Script
A specialized build script that properly handles both frontend (Vite) and backend (esbuild) compilation for Vercel.

### 3. **package-vercel.json** - Updated Package Configuration
Contains the correct build commands and all necessary dependencies.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Download Updated Files
1. Download the project again from Replit
2. It now includes all the fixes

### Step 2: Replace Files in GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Upload the new files, replacing the old ones
3. Make sure these key files are updated:
   - `vercel.json`
   - `build-vercel.js`
   - Replace `package.json` with `package-vercel.json` (rename it to `package.json`)

### Step 3: Vercel Configuration
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. **Settings** → **Build & Output Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
   - **Root Directory**: `.` (leave empty)

### Step 4: Environment Variables
Add your SendGrid API key:
- **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
- Name: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- Value: Your SendGrid API key

### Step 5: Deploy
1. **Deployments** tab → **Redeploy**
2. Monitor the build logs for success

## What Was Wrong vs. Fixed

### **Before (Broken):**
- Vercel couldn't find the correct entry point
- Build configuration was confused about the monorepo structure
- Missing proper build commands for the Vite setup

### **After (Fixed):**
- Clear build command that uses Vite for frontend
- Proper esbuild configuration for backend
- Correct routing for both API calls and static files
- Explicit output directories specified

## Expected Build Process

1. **Install**: `npm install` installs all dependencies
2. **Build Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public/`
3. **Build Backend**: esbuild compiles server to `dist/index.js`
4. **Deploy**: Vercel serves static files and API endpoints

## Success Indicators

✅ **Build completes without errors**  
✅ **Frontend loads at your Vercel URL**  
✅ **API endpoints work** (`/api/tickets`, etc.)  
✅ **Email notifications work** (with SendGrid API key)  
✅ **All pages and forms function correctly**

## If You Still Have Issues

### Check Build Logs
- Go to Vercel dashboard → your project → Deployments
- Click on the failed deployment
- Review the "Build Logs" section

### Common Solutions
1. **Node.js Version**: Ensure Vercel uses Node.js 18+
2. **Dependencies**: All packages are listed in the updated package.json
3. **Environment Variables**: Add SENDGRID_API_KEY if using email

### Alternative: Static Deployment
If the full-stack deployment still has issues:
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload only the `dist/public` folder to Netlify
3. Deploy as static site (no backend API)

The updated configuration should resolve all deployment issues and get your Victoria School Tech Help Desk live on Vercel with zero subscription costs.
